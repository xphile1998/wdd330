                <li>Okay... I know that this semester, my home life has been a trainwreak. I had to take my wife back to the ER because her GI bleed started back up and that ate up Monday and Tuesday. Then on Wednesday, they finally got all the pieces in place to send her back to the specialist in Phoenix to get this special procedure done. So, between getting all the insurance paperwork done with the LV hospital and driving the 5.5 hours from LV to my sister's place in Mesa, there, too, went Wednesday. So, here I am on Thursday, just starting my homework. </li>
                <li>Huzzah! (I've been reading about Revolutionary War history, and the founding fathers seemed to be somewhat enamored with this word...) My programming group met yesterday and recorded some of the meeting for me so that I could "attend" even though I was driving through the desert last night. :-)</li>
