                <li>This week has been a little off for me. I have been very focused on settling my wife in here back at home and coming up with a routine that works for taking care of here and getting my homework done.</li>
                <li>I am going to need to go back and rework the team assignment this week. I struggled with getting to work, so I am going to need to work on this on Saturday, after I finish my work on my Backend class.</li>
                <li>In particular, I need to really work on my ability to retrieve data back out of a LS file and display it properly.</li>
