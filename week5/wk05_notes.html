                <li>My first Python teacher said this about programming errors...</li>
                <li>"There are generally three ways that your program can fail. And they are in this order from least likely to most likely:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>User Error - Basically, this one does not really exist because if you wrote your code in such a way that the user can crash it, then you, as the programmer, commited the error by not catching it before your app hit production.</li>
                    <li>System Error - Again, most of the time when the system fails, it's usually because the programmer tried to do something that the system can't handle. So, again, this is really a programmer error.</li>
                    <li>Programmer Error - The hard reality is that every error that happens in an app or a program is becuase you didn't catch something, failed in your logic, or didn't anticipate an action or outcome. But that's okay. This is why we test and troubleshoot. This is how we find the human errors and get them corrected before our customers ever see the finished product. </li>
                </ul>
                <li>I tried messing around with the example code for JEST, but wasn't able to get the results that the author got. Maybe I'm going to need to spend some time on https://jestjs.io/ and see what I need to do to install and work this on my Chromebook (Linux Debian 11).</li>
                <li>'use strict'; - I can't believe that this is the first class that I've heard of this is JS programming. I think that I am going to probably find the use of this line of code to be somewhat frustrating, at least at first. I'm sure that there is a LOT of stuff that I am writing that is very sloppy. ;-) </li>
                <li>Nothing more at this time...</li>
