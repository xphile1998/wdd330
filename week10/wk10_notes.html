                <li>I'm just going to start off with an apology on being so behind this week. My wife was released from the hospital on Thursday evening of last week and I had to spend a significant portion of my Friday arranging for her to see an IBD specialist that was recommended by her GI surgeon. After that, I had to get her to see doctors on Monday for hospital follow up and the aforementioned IBD specialist. None of those appointments went as hoped, leaving us with little more than a direction to take, rather than a cure to pursue. :'(</li>
                <li>On Tuesday, we attempted to return to Las Vegas since Phoenix, once a beacon of hope, turned out instead to be just more time wasted. Literally on the way out to the car, my wife lost all sense of balance and fell hard on the sidewalk, managing to crack her coxyx and bumping her head and getting an egg-sized bump on her head. After 12 hours of observation (about 3:30 AM) they decided that other than a cracked coxyx and a large hematoma on the back of her head, there was little else they could do for her and realeased us. Discharge took another couple of hours and so with no where else to go, we started the 5 hour journey back to Vegas.</li>
                <li>When we arrived home we discovered a HUGE side effect of the bump to the head being that my wife has very little sense of balance and long carride had sapped her of any lower body strength. So, getting her from the truck to the house became a production and involved me, my two sons, and a brand new wheelchair. This last issue, the inability to stand up on her own (she is now able to stand for a few minutes, once she's vertical, and can even walk very short distances, with help. However, she cannot move more than about 20 steps before she topples over, so I am having to be available at her beck and call and we are learning how to deal with all this change in her circumstances.</li>
                <li>Due to all of this, I have had almost no time this week to work on homework. I barely did the reading, which overlapped reading that I had already done for my CSE340 class a couple of weeks ago (which was a help, for sure!). I also failed to meet with my team this week and also forgot to ask them to record their meeting so that I could "attend" after the fact.</li>
                <li>Again, I offer all this as a means of explanation and not to excuse my lack of performance.</li>
