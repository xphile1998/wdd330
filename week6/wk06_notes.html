                <li>I spent the first part of the week (Monday and Tuesday) getting ready to move my wife back to Las Vegas (home) after having been in Phoenix for a month. That took a bit of my week up, obviously.</li>
                <li>I then spent Wednesday finishing my midterm assignment for CSE340.</li>
                <li>I then worked on my ToDo List assigment the rest of the week.</li>
                <li>One thing that I did in preparation for this assignment was to look at <strong>LOTS</strong> of YouTube tutorials on at least a dozen different ways to do this assignment. Hopefully, I have found a way that is mine.</li>
