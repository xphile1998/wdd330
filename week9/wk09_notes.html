                <li>This week my team and I worked our way through the team assignment. We got all the main stuff working and are on our way to sovling the movement piece, although it is currently only able to increment by 10 to 100 and then reset the count. We are still working on it.</li>
                <li>I have downloaded and installed the tools folder. I was able to successfully run the version checks as outlined in the homework.</li>
                <li>After reading this week, I am left, not so much with questions, but rather with a feeling of being a bit overwhelmed with just how many methods, etc, that we covered. And I have noticed this a lot when it comes to JS and, to some extent, CSS; there are a LOT of methods, properties, attributes, et al, to remember. I was thinking that maybe someone needs to come up with a reference guide that looks up information in a plain English format, like, "I need to animate a square box" or "how do I move an element on the page". Something to think about, maybe...</li>
