                <li>It was fun going back over variables, arrays, and functions. One thing that I learned that was new to me was that the VAR method of declaring a variable was "outdated". This would explain why CONST and LET are the two methods that I have used in class, despite having learned all three.</li>
                <li>Arrays are both a blessing and bane to me. I love the concepts and I've been able to successfully use them in my programming, but I often have to refer back to references to make sure that I am using them correctly. I am looking forward to getting more familiar with them this semester.</li>
