                <li>Forms - I read throrugh the chapter, but I am honestly feeling like this is a little bit of waiting for the other shoe to drop. I'm always glad for a review, but I (at least) did not get to really practice forms in any of the coding work that we did on this week's assignment. However, I was glad for the chance to review this concept.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>I remember reading somewhere in one of my texts from my last JS class that the current recommendation on the best way to use reset buttons was to NOT. Couldn't find it though. </li>
                </ul>
                <li> More Objects - I think my favorite part of the reading this week was the concept of Monkey Patching. I had never heard this term before, but I have heard of apparently terms, such as Gorilla Patching and Guerilla Patching, which all appear to mean the same thing. It was fun to learn another term. However, as mentioned in the text, it would seem that using the EXTENDS feature to add additional functionality would be the better choice. Or am I missing something?</li>
